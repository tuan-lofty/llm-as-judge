Our Vision
AI-powered products are the catalyst for exponential growth across all our applications, driving innovation and transforming our entire business ecosystem.

Our Strategy
The platform team will develop the core AI logic, which other teams can utilize to create AI features for their business end users. The main idea is to make the platform become the source of AI power that flowing to other product innovation channels, hence the name Flow Engine (FE).

By decoupling the platform team, we enable rapid innovation and alignment with advancements in the AI space without disrupting other business operations. This approach also enhances cost efficiency through the reusability of the platform's products.

Our Users
Lofty and TruckerPath development team and future business lines.

Problem
Our users need a platform that provides foundational large language models (LLMs) and relevant services to enable them to innovate and launch AI-based features that drive value for their customers.

Solution Summary
